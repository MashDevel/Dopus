# Dopus

A lightweight tool-first framework for AI agent application development. Create an `Agent` class and decorate your tool functions with `@tool`. It just works.

Dopus is designed for building AI agents and their tools on top of existing LLM providers. In the spirit of being lightweight, it doesn't include any agents or tools out of the box.
