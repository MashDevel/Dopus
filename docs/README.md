# Dopus

Minimal easy-to-use framework for creating agentic applications.

## Overview

Dopus is a lightweight framework for AI agent application development. It contains simple abstractions that enable you to quickly create agent classes and it's functions as tools. 

Dopus is designed for building AI agents and their tools on top of existing LLM providers. It doesn't include any agents or tools out of the box.
